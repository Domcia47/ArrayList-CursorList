Two implementations of linked list:

array list - implementaion using array, allowing easier access to elements than pointer implementation but making insertion more complex

curosor list - implementation using array of structs, where every struct contains value and index of next element;
This implementation combines adavanatges of pointer and array implementation, but needs more memory.
